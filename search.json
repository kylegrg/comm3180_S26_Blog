Over half of the students scored within the top quartile of Extraversion and Conscientiousness. Additionally, 80% of students scored within the top two quartiles of Agreeableness scores. Intellect and Imagination scores leaned toward the high end, and Emotional Stability scores were the most evenly distributed.\nThis breakdown speaks to the personalities of Penn students. The high scores for Conscientiousness and Extraversion speaks to Penn’s reputation as the “social ivy,” while widely distributed Emotion Stability scores suggest a broad range of emotional experiences among students. Overall, these patterns reflect a student body that is highly driven and socially engaged, but varied in how individuals respond to stress and emotional challenges."

    "text": "Conclusion\nOverall, this comparison indicates that the personality differences observed in the COMM 3180 sample cannot be explained solely by age, since the Penn students differ substantially from other 17–22-year-olds in the international dataset. Instead, these results likely reflect characteristics of Penn’s student population specifically, including a tendency toward higher conscientiousness, sociability, and interpersonal cooperation. Age may play a role in personality development, but institutional environment appears to be a stronger contributor to the patterns seen here."

Though only a difference of less than a week, these numbers point toward an upward trend in rainfall. So, the annual total rainfall must be increasing as well, right? WRONG!\n\n\nRainfall\n\nannual_rainfall=weather_df.groupby(\"year\")[\"rain\"].sum()\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nannual_rainfall.plot(kind=\"bar\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Total Rainfall\")\nplt.title(\"Annual Rainfall in Philadelphia (2005–2025)\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe annual rainfall has decreased over the past 21 years from 47.3 inches (2005-2015) to 44.2 inches (2015-2025). The difference in these trends shows that annual rainfall considerably varies from year to year, and there doesn’t seem to be a clear-cut trend in Philly’s rainfall patterns.\n\n\nRain Levels\nTo better understand this data, I used the Bhutan National Center for Hydrology and Meteorology’s 7-point scale of 24-hour rainfall intensity to categorize each day based on amount of rainfall, from “no rain” or “very light rain” to “extremely heavy rainfall” (https://www.nchm.gov.bt/attachment/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rainfall%20intensity%20classification.pdf).\n\nweather_df['no_rain'] = weather_df[\"rain\"] == 0\nweather_df['very_light_rain'] = (\n    (25.4*weather_df[\"rain\"] &gt; 0) &\n    (25.4*weather_df[\"rain\"] &lt; 1)\n)\nweather_df['light_rain'] = (\n    (25.4*weather_df[\"rain\"] &gt;= 1) &\n    (25.4*weather_df[\"rain\"] &lt; 10)\n)\nweather_df['moderate_rain'] = (\n    (25.4*weather_df[\"rain\"] &gt;= 10) &\n    (25.4*weather_df[\"rain\"] &lt; 30)\n)\nweather_df['heavy_rain'] = (\n    (25.4*weather_df[\"rain\"] &gt;= 30) &\n    (25.4*weather_df[\"rain\"] &lt; 70)\n)\nweather_df['very_heavy_rain'] = (\n    (25.4*weather_df[\"rain\"] &gt;= 70) &\n    (25.4*weather_df[\"rain\"] &lt; 150)\n)\nweather_df['extremely_heavy_rain'] = 25.4*weather_df[\"rain\"] &gt;= 150\n\nrain_levels = [\n    'very_light_rain', 'light_rain', 'moderate_rain', 'heavy_rain', 'very_heavy_rain', 'extremely_heavy_rain'\n]\n\nrain_by_year = weather_df.groupby(\"year\")[rain_levels].sum()\nrain_by_year.plot(figsize=(15,10), marker=\"o\").set_xticks(rain_by_year.index);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrain_by_year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvery_light_rain\nlight_rain\nmoderate_rain\nheavy_rain\nvery_heavy_rain\nextremely_heavy_rain\n\n\nyear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2005\n28\n55\n26\n5\n2\n0\n\n\n2006\n22\n49\n31\n9\n0\n0\n\n\n2007\n24\n63\n25\n8\n1\n0\n\n\n2008\n28\n56\n24\n9\n0\n0\n\n\n2009\n25\n62\n31\n13\n0\n0\n\n\n2010\n24\n45\n25\n7\n2\n0\n\n\n2011\n32\n56\n25\n13\n4\n0\n\n\n2012\n21\n61\n25\n3\n1\n0\n\n\n2013\n24\n57\n27\n8\n2\n1\n\n\n2014\n20\n65\n29\n6\n1\n0\n\n\n2015\n25\n47\n32\n8\n1\n0\n\n\n2016\n25\n55\n26\n5\n0\n0\n\n\n2017\n36\n58\n19\n11\n0\n0\n\n\n2018\n24\n69\n42\n9\n1\n0\n\n\n2019\n29\n78\n31\n7\n1\n0\n\n\n2020\n22\n62\n32\n7\n2\n0\n\n\n2021\n26\n55\n29\n7\n1\n0\n\n\n2022\n15\n67\n32\n7\n0\n0\n\n\n2023\n24\n56\n30\n7\n0\n0\n\n\n2024\n19\n68\n19\n6\n1\n0\n\n\n2025\n32\n57\n24\n7\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above graph and table are rather illuminating to Philadelphia’s rainfall trends. Though there was an increase in the annual number of days with light rainfall, there was a decrease in the annual number of days with heavy or very heavy rainfall. Additionally, the only “extreme” rain event in Philadelphia occurred in 2013, accounting for over 8 inches of rain in a single day (over 14% of the year’s total rainfall!).\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall, the change in rain patterns warrants further analysis. The actual amount of rain that falls each year seems to be decreasing, yet more days are considered to be “rainy.” This incongruity creates an illusion of increased rainfall when, in reality, the opposite is true. Such a shift toward more frequent but less intense precipitation could have important implications for water resource management, urban drainage systems, and perceptions of climate variability in the region."
